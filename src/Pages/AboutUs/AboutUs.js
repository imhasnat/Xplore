                    <p className="mt-2">We envision a world where anyone, anywhere has the power to transform their life through learning. Learning is the source of human progress.It has the power to transform our world from illness to health, rom poverty to prosperity, from conflict to peace. It has the power to transform our lives for ourselves, for our families, for our communities. No matter who we are or where we are, learning empowers us to change and grow and redefine what’s possible. That’s why access to the best learning is a right, not a privilege. And that’s why XPLORE is here. We partner with the best institutions to bring the best learning to every corner of the world. So that anyone, anywhere has the power totransform their life through learning.</p>
